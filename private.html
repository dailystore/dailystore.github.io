            <p class="workload-analyzer">
                Analyzing workloads from an SAP HANA database with the workload analyzer can help you identify the root
                cause of performance issues.
            </p>
            <p class="workload-analyzer">
                The workload analyzer is a tool that allows you to analyze the workload occurring in a system
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The workload analyzer based on thread samples. It is a solution for analyzing database performance
                    using thread samples. This version uses thread
                    samples data to analyze the
                    performance. It provides a workload analysis using different KPIs, and it offers the following
                    information sets: On the upper part of the screen, the chart displays the system resource usage.
                    The chart displays both a real-time and a historical analysis. The information displayed on the
                    grey background represents the historical analysis of the workload. Both analysis types are based
                    on the sampling data. However, the historical analysis contains only aggregated data. On the lower
                    part of the screen, the main analysis page offers the following four sections: Top SQL Statements,
                    Background Jobs, Timeline, Threads.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="workload-analyzer">
                In conclusion, the workload analyzer gives you an overview of the system's health at a glance.
                Moreover, the tool helps you identify the root cause of performance issues either by a real-time
                analysis or by reviewing historical data.

            <ul>
                <li>The workload analyzer based on engine instrumentation. It is a solution for analyzing database
                    performances based on the workload captured with the capture and replay tool. This version of the
                    tool performs the analysis using the captured data containing all the statistics of the query
                    execution. Furthermore, it allows a deeper analysis with a full set of execution details. It offers
                    you two analysis types, on the upper part of the screen, the chart displays the system resource
                    usage, on the lower part of the screen, three sections are displayed with further analysis such as
                    capture information, top SQL statements, timeline.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="workload-analyzer">
                In contrast to the workload analyzer based on thread samples, using this tool requires to capture the
                workload before analyzing the performance. Capturing all the workload by default is not recommended
                because it introduces an overhead to system performance.
