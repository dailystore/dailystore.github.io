        TasteTruyen PhoneGap App Audio Playing Problem
      </h2>

      <p style="text-align: right">
        <small>September 19, 2017</small>
      </p>

      <div class="commit-message" style="text-align: justify;">
        <p>Attempt to fix audio playing problem (described below) on the specific Chrome version 67.0.3396.87 of Sony
          X1A
          Plus model with Android 8.0.0 and Chrome version 67.0.X.X (also the forcefully updated 68.0.3440.70) of Sony
          Xperia
          Z4 (SO - 03G Japan version) with Android 7.0.0.</p>
        <p>The problem is this warning (in WebView console) keeps popping up a lot right after the play button is
          clicked to
          start playing, preventing audio from being played:</p>
        <p> 6 The AudioContext was not allowed to start. It must be resumed (or created) from a user gesture event
          handler.</p>
        <p>The number 6 at the beginning denotes how many times this warning repeated. The only way to successfully
          start
          playing is to repeat these exact steps:</p>
        <p> First, after iframe finished loading, click the play button (the warning will appear).</p>
        <p> Next, almost immediately jump ahead or back by clicking (or sliding) on the seek bar. Make sure you jump
          before
          the warning count hit 7 or 8 (6 or below is fine). Too late and the SoundCloud iframe stucks forever and
          won't
          budge no matter how many jumps we throw at it (but a simple iframe reload could reset the state to the origin
          and
          we can repeat the steps again).</p>
        <p>Most of the times, the steps above will work and the sound is played but it's extremely awkward. Some
          suspects as
          to how it happens like that:</p>
        <p> Somehow, a queue within SoundCloud iframe, being used to store cross-origin commands (play, pause, seek)
          sent by
          window.postMessage() from us for gradual processing, get stuck from receiving commands repeatedly but unable
          to
          process due to being blocked by the warning. As a consequence, subsequent commands are delayed indefinitely
          but we
          have no way to resolve it externally, except fiddling with codes from SoundCloud.</p>
        <p> A very small but possible chance of a browser bug (in this case, specifically Chrome) that though we
          strictly
          follow official instructions and synchronously send play command to SoundCloud iframe only from a "click"
          event
          handler registered on our play button, the gesture-token necessary to acquire auto-play permission somehow
          can't
          reach the inside of the iframe. Only by waiting for the "click" event to happen at least 1 more time could
          the
          token finally reach its intended destination and grant the necessary permission.</p>

        <p>[...] An AudioContext is said to be allowed to start if the user agent and the system allow audio output in
          the
          current context. In other words, if the AudioContext control thread state is allowed to transition from
          suspended
          to running.</p>
        <p>Note: For example, a user agent could require that an AudioContext control thread state change to running is
          triggered by user activation (as described in [HTML]). [...] (excerpt from <a href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioContext"
            rel="nofollow" class="ap-connect-link">https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioContext</a>)</p>
        <p>[...] An algorithm is triggered by user activation if any of the following conditions is true:</p>
        <p> + The task in which the algorithm is running is currently processing an activation behavior whose click
          event's
          isTrusted attribute is true.</p>
        <p> + The task in which the algorithm is running is currently running the event listener for an event whose
          isTrusted
          attribute is true and whose type is one of:</p>
        <p> change click contextmenu dblclick mouseup pointerup reset submit touchend</p>
        <p> + The task in which the algorithm is running was queued by an algorithm that was triggered by user
          activation,
          and the chain of such algorithms started within a user-agent defined timeframe.</p>
        <p>For example, if a user clicked a button, it might be acceptable for a popup to result from that after 4
          seconds,
          but it would likely not be acceptable for a popup to result from that after 4 hours. [...] (excerpt from <a
